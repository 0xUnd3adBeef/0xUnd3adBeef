## About

I’m a 16 year old security student focused on **penetration testing**, **Active Directory exploitation** and **Web Exploitation**.
My work tends to focus on hands on lab practice and experiments.

Currently expanding my skill set through lab environments, capture-the-flag challenges, and real-world simulation exercises.

## Selected Projects

### **AdPeek** (A poor man's AD enumeration tool)

AdPeek is a small Python tool for extracting useful information from Active Directory over LDAP. It focuses on fast enumeration and identifying misconfigured ACL paths without requiring a database or GUI (Poor man's bloodhound-ce).
